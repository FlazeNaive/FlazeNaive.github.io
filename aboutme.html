Hi, I'm Qingyi HE (though I always go by Flaze online).
</p>

<p class="about-text">
I'm currently working on a Master's in Computer Science 
at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne(EPFL)</a> 
specializing in Foundations of Software – programming languages, compilers, and some other low-levelled staffs. 
</p>

<p class="about-text">
Before this, I did my undergrad at <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University</a> and 
survived from <a href="https://www.cdqz.net/">Chengdu No.7 High School</a>.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
Welcome and I hope you find something interesting here.
